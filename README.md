# Java Tibetan Text Tools

Perhaps misnamed for now but hope to collect a set of useful methods for working with Tibetan unicode text. Library is for Java without dependencies on Scala, however build and test is Scala (2.12) based.

## To Do

- [x] Fix mappings in WYLIE
- [x] Add tests
- [ ] Convert to pattern matcher rather than blind loops
